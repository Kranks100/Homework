        We are the Gym of the TryFecta and we hope you will Join us in our pursuit to Become greater. Our tenants of group strength come from our three 
        founders who choose to only be known as "The Three Above". They believe there are three major parts to proper exercise:Persistence, Harmony, and 
        confidence.

<h2>We hold the concept of group encouragement in highest regard due to the experiences of our founders 
  pushing each other forward in their own journeys. There are no personal trainers, only fellow members that will give you the much needed
  boost past what your mind thinks your limit is.

    Of course, our gyms are all filled with the conventional equipment you would find in most others. Our gym however, sets levels to who can use the 
    equipment for reasons that protect and encourage those who are not yet ready to use them. our levels of commitment for this consists of three levels:
    Initiate, Adept, and Beyond(*Beyond ranked gym equipment is not posted on site due to private membership status.)
